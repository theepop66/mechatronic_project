# 🚗 AI-Based Regenerative Suspension System
> A Quarter-Car prototype that uses Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize the trade-off between **Ride Comfort** and **Energy Harvesting**.

## 📖 Project Overview
Traditional vehicle suspension systems waste kinetic energy as heat (friction) in oil dampers. This project replaces the standard damper with a **Regenerative damper**.

By using a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent**, the system actively controls the damping force in real-time. It stiffens the suspension to harvest maximum energy on highways and softens it instantly to absorb shocks on rough roads, ensuring passenger comfort while recharging the battery.

### Key Innovations
* **Regenerative Braking for Suspension:** Converts vertical vibration into electricity (12V DC).
* **AI Control Logic:** Replaces fixed PID/Passive damping with an adaptive RL Agent.
* **Physical Validation:** Tested on a custom-built Quarter-Car Test Rig.
